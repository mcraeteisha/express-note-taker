# express-note-taker
Note Taker is an application that can be used to write and save notes. The application was built using an Express.js back end and can save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* JavaScript
* Express
 
## Work Completed

To complete this project, I created a HTML, CSS, and Javascript files to build a code quiz.

Using VS Code, I completed the following:

* Created HTML routes that returned HTML files to the user.
* Created API routes that returned JSON data to the user and saved the user's notes to a JSON file.
* Connected the Express back-end of the application to the HTML front-end.
* Deployed the application to Heroku.
 
## Learnings and Issues
 
This project required some independent learning and also allowed me to apply classroom lessons to a real-world scenario.

Some of the learnings Iâ€™m taking away from this project are:
1. Understanding how routes should be set up and how they work with the server.
2. Making the list items clickable eluded me.
3. My TA helped me with my file structure and helped me to better understand how this particular assignment should be organized and why I was running into issues with my previous file setup.
4. Deploying to Heroku.

## Future Application Updates

* Add a functioning delete button
* Get active note/clicked note to appear in the right-hand of the screen
